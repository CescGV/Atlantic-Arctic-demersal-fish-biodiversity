# Norwegian_sp


# This are the different scripts used for the analysis of the Norwegian bottom trawling database of the IMR. There are 4 scripts:


1. The first script to look at is the "Data exploration" --> In it, I try to investigate the characteristics of the database 
in terms of temporal and spatial distribution of the data. At the end, I fit a GAM model to study how has the species richness changed with time, considering
that the effort is different at each trawl, with a negative trend with time. 

2. Alpha diversity --> Once understood that the species richness at each site (alpha diversity) has declined with time, I would like investigate
the environmental drivers of this change, which afterwards allow for a spatial modelling of the alpha diversity. 

3. Beta diversity --> Traditional approach to beta diversity
4. 
5. Gamma diversity --> SAC curves for gamma diversity considering the effort (Sites). It is relevant to keep in mind that the effort at each site is not the same
(remember that the swept area at each trawl declines with time) but the shape of the SAC suggests that the area has been properly every year.
