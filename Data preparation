# There is a correlation between number of cells per year (n), and species richness per cell (lambda).

# When gathering the trawlings in 1x1 lat long cells, some cells contain several trawls. 
# This increases the area a lot in these cells, and this needs to be considered when looking for potential biases. 
# Also, it looks as if there was less area per each site from 2011 onwards, although there were more cells.
# This trend would diminish if I selected points with even more
# years, not only more than 5 years of data but maybe 15.

# This trend needs to be considered. First 10 years have less points in the whole area,
# but each point does not contain less trawling, neither less area! (Actually contains more area)
# Even if there is an overall decline in swept area, this would imply that our results would be exacerbated,
